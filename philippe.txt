I found out at the age of 22 that I needed adventure and art to feel alive! Thus I quitted my scientific studies at the university and started a life of painting and traveling. Since over 15 years I traveled by train, by bus, by car, by bicycle, by hitchhiking and even by horse! To finally end up traveling by walk. It's the best way to me to feel my journey: using my feet, my step to travel.
By traveling I reload myself of energy and visions; and then unload the whole by painting.
As I tried different ways to travel, I tried different technics to paint; to finally find out that oil on canvas and using my fingers as tool to paint was the way I needed. My artwork is first of all about Nature and Earth; but more than representing Nature by its concrete elements, in a figurative way, I try to communicate the feeling of the forces at work in Nature and how the mankind feels these forces within himself and then how he interacts with. I aim with my artwork to revive the idea of a life in harmony with the forces of Nature, to find again the roots who connect us to the Earth.
Paint the Earth and all who takes root upon Her, us as well as trees: that's the purpose of my painting!
Maybe traveling is also searching for his roots: that's the connection I found between traveling and painting.
